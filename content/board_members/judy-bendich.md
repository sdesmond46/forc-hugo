Judith (Judy) Bendich and her husband (Arnie) are long-term Ravenna residents. Judy is a retired lawyer, has been involved as a neighborhood advocate over many years, and has served on quite a few non-profit organization boards. Judy represented Friends of Ravenna-Cowen in the administrative appeal against the City of Seattle because the city proposed to upzone sections of what is now the Ravenna-Cowen North National Historic District. Ultimately, Friends of Ravenna-Cowen prevailed. Judy has found it a pleasure working with Friends of Ravenna-Cowen, a truly dedicated and caring group of people and, through this organization, meeting, and getting to know the remarkable people who live here and the many other friends who do not live here but who have helped with its mission, "To preserve and protect the heritage of the Ravenna-Cowen neighborhood as a shared community resource for all."
