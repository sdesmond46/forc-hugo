In late 2018, FORC applied for a City of Seattle Small Sparks grant from the Department of Neighborhoods (DON) to install Historic District street signs. The application was approved in 2019, and the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) installed the signs in February 2020. The signs were paid for by a combination of volunteer time spent by FORC volunteers and matching funds from the Small Sparks grant. The signs are official brown (denoting historic significance) and are mounted on street poles or light poles at 12 approved locations that will help identify the Ravenna-Cowen North National Historic District.
