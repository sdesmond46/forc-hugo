We held our fourth walking tour on Saturday, October 7, 2023. This tour focused on the Ravenna Park, the beautiful park that is adjacent to and south of the District. Larry Johnson led one of two groups for the walking tour. He was assisted by board member Lani Johnson, as well as volunteer Dante Moreno. Board member Francesca Renouard and her husband Steven Pool led the second group, assisted by Dr. Lewis Johnson. Research on the park's history took several months and revealed the location and fate of the once majestic three hundred feet tall fir trees that were found within the park. Master Birder and naturalist Wood Wheeler also gave a presentation on the park's natural history.
