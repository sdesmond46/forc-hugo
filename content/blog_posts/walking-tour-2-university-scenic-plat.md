On May 6, 2023, FORC hosted our second historical interest walk through the central section of the Historic District. About 60 neighbors participated with FORC president, Larry E. Johnson, AIA, leading the group and pointing out points of interest along the way.

You can download Walk #2 below and take a self-guided tour too. This one covers the middle portion of the Ravenna-Cowen North National Historic District, east of 15th Avenue NE and extending to 20 th Avenue NE.
